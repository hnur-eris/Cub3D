# Cub3D
The Cub3D Project is a project aimed at developing a simple maze game using real-time 3D graphics. In this project, the user will navigate through the maze by controlling a character and try to achieve certain goals. In the project, the raycasting technique is used to display 2D maze maps in 3D.
