# Cub3D
The Cub3D Project is a project aimed at developing a simple maze game using real-time 3D graphics. In this project, the user will navigate through the maze by controlling a character and try to achieve certain goals. In the project, the raycasting technique is used to display 2D maze maps in 3D. 


The necessary steps for the game to work:
First of all, you should install the minilibx library on your computer.
When you extract and compile the files I uploaded from the zip in a zip way, there will be a 3D game in front of you.
